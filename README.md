# RealtimeTextEditor
RealtimeTextEditor is php app that uses POST to create nearly realtime editing experience. It uses POST because of php execution limit standard hostings utilize, this does not allow me to use sockets (I might be wrong, open issue if you know otherwise).
It is still in active development so things will be broken, download only releases if you want something that works
